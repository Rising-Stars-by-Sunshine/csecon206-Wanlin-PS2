### Structure

This project reviews the fundamental concepts of game theory, simulates some typical games, and elaborates on the Nash Equilibrium. The project can be divided into two parts: Overleaf and Google Colab.

In Overleaf, this project will review the essential concepts of game theory. It will first go through the significant milestones of game theory by citing the original publication. Then, it will provide some definitions, theorems, and proof of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. Finally, it will list a game theory glossy table to show some critical terminologies of game theory. 

In Google Colab, the project will introduce one normal form matrix game, the Cournot Duopoly game, and one extensive form game, the Centipede Game. And it will solve their equilibrium separately using Nashpy and game theory explorer. Some brief elaborations will be provided.

### Spotlight

After a long development period, game theory has a relatively complete theoretical system, especially the theoretical framework based on Nash equilibrium. However, the lack of interdisciplinary integration makes applying these theories to reality complex. For example, as shown in the project：

* The Nash Equilibrium in the Cournot Duopoly game indicates that both firms will choose to have a low output regardless of the other’s choices. But based on life experience, homogenous firms tend to produce more rather than less, and surpluses occur much more often than shortages. 
* In the centipede game, the result of SPNE is that players 1 and 2 never cooperate, and the game ends in the first round, and both player 1 and player 2 lose all potential benefits. This result aligns with the theory, but reality often doesn’t work like this. No matter in the class, when playing the Centipede game or other similar scenarios in real life, players are likelier to cooperate, regardless of breaking in the middle or collaborating until the last round. Moreover, the choices made by the same player may differ according to the time or the place. 

In other words, to predict the games in real life, people must consider the dynamics of more complex factors (e.g., psychology, society, and the environment, etc.) Thus, this project points out the shortcomings of game theory and inspires people to consider the impact of various complex factors further comprehensively on real-world games.

My name is Wanlin Deng, and you can also call me Iris. I’m from the class of 2025 and my major is political Economy with a track in economics. I’m interested in the interdisciplinary field of computational economics. Now, I’m working on utilizing all the math, econ and coding knowledge to study economics in a more critical way, and hope to become a competitive person who possesses a truly interdisciplinary capability. <br>

Nice to meet you guys here and look forward to our future cooperation!
